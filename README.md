Mini Gomuku Game With AI
# Gomoku AI Project

## Overview

Welcome to our Gomoku AI project! This repository contains the code and resources for developing an AI program that plays the game of Gomoku, also known as "five in a row". This project is a collaborative effort by Rakibul Islam(bsse1210@iit.du.ac.bd), Sazzad Hossain(bsse1207@iit.du.ac.bd), Yasisr Araft Araf(bsse1220@iit.du.ac.bd).

## Description

Gomoku is a two-player board game played on a 10x10 grid, where players take turns placing stones on the intersections. The goal is to connect five stones of the same color in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Our project involves developing an AI opponent that can play Gomoku against human players or other AIs.
